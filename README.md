This repository contains a template for customizing the Tableau Desktop Discover Pane.
The Discover Pane is part of start page of Tableau Desktop, specifically the right side pane which is loaded from a website.

If you are planning to provide your own content for this pane, the HTML and CSS files in this respository can be used on a webserver (provided by you) to give a similar experience to the existing Discover Pane.  Additionally you can modify the HTML with your own links.  You will need to [configure Tableau Desktop to use the URL that points to the web url hosting this html](https://help.tableau.com/v2020.1/desktopdeploy/en-us/desktop_deploy_setting_changes.htm).


### Requirements:
* A webserver that hosts the html and css files ([IIS](https://www.iis.net), [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org), [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com), etc.).
* Tableau Desktop (v2020.1 or higher) configured to point to the URL of the HTML on the webserver via https.
* For best results donâ€™t use web pages that include redirects.
